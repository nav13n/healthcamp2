#Visualization and recommendation tool to control child mortality rate
Application co-hacked with [Abul](https://github.com/abulbasar/healthcamp2) during India Data Hack - A hackathon sponsored by NASSCOM 100000 Startups and IBM Bluemix. 

##Description: 
The heat-map represents the mortality index values per district of West Bengal, India. A model to calculate mortality index has been created by examining the maternal care, ante-natal care and child immunization data available on [data.gov.in](http://data.gov.in/) for year 2011 and 2012.

Technology: Solution is hosted on [IBM Bluemix cloud](http://healthcamp2.mybluemix.net/). Source code is maintained in this Github repository.The sample is using [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and heatmap is developed using d3.js.
